Description: This package implements R functions that interact with the Linux
    kernel to enforce security restrictions on an R process. Mandatory access
    control (MAC) policies can be applied by loading an apparmor profiles. In
    addition, the package can set hardware limits (rlimit), uid, gid, affinity
    and priority of the current process, directly from within R. The high level
    function eval.secure builds on these foundations to do dynamic sandboxing:
    it evaluates a single expression under irreversible security restrictions
    and hardware limits without any side effects on R session.
