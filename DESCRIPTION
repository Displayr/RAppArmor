Description: Bindings to various methods in the kernel for enforcing security
    restrictions on a given task (process). AppArmor can apply mandatory access
    control (MAC) policies by loading a profile, setting hardware limits (rlimit),
    uid, gid, affinity and priority of the current process, directly from within
    R. The high level function eval.secure builds on these foundations to support
    dynamic sandboxing: it evaluates a single expression in a temporary fork with
    hard security restrictions and hardware limits without any side effects on the
    main R session.
