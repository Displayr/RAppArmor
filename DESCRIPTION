Description: This package implements R functions that interact with the Linux
    kernel to apply security restrictions on an R process. The main feature is
    to enforce mandatory access control (MAC) policies by applying an apparmor
    profile. In addition, the package supports setting hardware limits
    (rlimit), uid, gid, affinity and priority on the current process.
    Everything in the package comes together using the highly flexible
    eval.secure function, which can enforce hard security restrictions on a
    single evaluation without side effects on the current process.
