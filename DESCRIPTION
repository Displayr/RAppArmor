Description: Bindings to various methods in the kernel for enforcing security
    restrictions on a given task (process). AppArmor can apply mandatory access
    control (MAC) policies via security profiles which contain detailed access
    control definitions. In addition this package supports setting hardware
    limits (rlimit), uid, gid, affinity and priority of the process, directly
    from within R. The high level function 'eval.secure' builds on these methods
    to support dynamic sandboxing: it evaluates an R expression within a temporary
    fork which acts as a sandbox by enforcing fine grained security restrictions
    and hardware limits, yet without side effects on the main R session.
