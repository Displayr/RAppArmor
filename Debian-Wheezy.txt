NOTES ABOUT DEBIAN:

- AppArmor is currently only available in Debian "Testing". 
- For AppArmor to work on Debian, it needs to be version 2.7.103-4 or higher. This version ships with Debian 7 beta 2 and up. 
- As for now, Debian does not support 'network rules' in AppArmor. Everything else works fine.

To activate AppArmor on Debian, run the following steps:

1) Install the latest version of Debian Wheezy.

2) sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

3) Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and add "apparmor=1 security=apparmor" to your boot line(s). E.g it will read:

title Default
root (hd0)
kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/xvda1 ro apparmor=1 security=apparmor
initrd /initrd.img

4) Reboot

5) sudo apt-get install r-base-dev
   sudo apt-get install libapparmor-dev apparmor-utils   

6) sudo service apparmor restart

7) continue with regular install of R / RAppArmor
